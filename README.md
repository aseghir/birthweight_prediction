# Birthweight_prediction
This project was done to clean and analyze a dataset consisting of factors that influence the weight of a baby, and eventually make a predictive model using the data.

STEP 1

Download all the files, a zip file is also availabe for your convenience. After extracting all the files, open any Python IDE (This project was created with Spyder) and change the working directory to the one with the folder containing all the files. OR, open the command prompt, go to the root directory with all the files, and write the command python birth_weight.py to execute the python file.(It is better to open the python file in an IDE to make sure all the dependencies are installed correctly and the code is error free.)

STEP 2
Install the dependencies and execute the code.

STEP 3
Open the file called Report.docx to read the report.

STEP 4
do not hesitate to get in touch regarding any feedback or questions :)

Thank you.
